Custom launcher for launching GawdScape (Minecraft)

The GawdScape Launcher will download the GawdScape mod and Minecraft.

This launcher was created to make opening the game faster.

It resembles the older style launcher, it also doesn't redownload its self every launch either.

There is also more, easier to use settings.

Refer to the Wiki for help.

Updates in Version 3:

Custom launcher for launching GawdScape (Minecraft)

The GawdScape Launcher will download the [GawdMod](https://github.com/GawdScape/GawdMod), your choice of [Mod Pack](https://github.com/GawdScape/GawdPack), and Minecraft.

This launcher was created to make launching the game faster while providing additional modding features and customizations.

You should be able to both download and launch Minecraft faster then the official Launcher.

Based on your computer, the GawdScape Launcher is probably at least 10 times faster then Technic or FTB launcher.

It resembles the look of the old style launcher while providing the functionality of the rop Minecraft launchers.

There is also more, easier to use settings. You can change almost every launch argument from the Settings menu.

It make modding Minecraft simple as well. For jar mods, simply darg the jar to the `<ModPack>/bin` folder.
